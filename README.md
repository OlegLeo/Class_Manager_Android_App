# Class_Manager_Android_App

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


This Project was developed during the Web & Mobile Development course.

The objective was to develop an application that manages classes and students.

The base of the project is in Java OOP.

In addition to having some bases in object orientation, this time I also learned to associate with the visual interface layout of elements.
